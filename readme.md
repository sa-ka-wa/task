TASK 1:
Write a program that has an array or a list a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25].
Make a new array/list of only the first and last elements of the given array/list above.

TASK 2:
Prompt the user for a number either on a form input or the terminal. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, display either “odd” or “even” to the user.
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

TASK 3:
Write a program that gets a phone number from a form input or terminal. Validates the phone number by checking if it starts with +254.. or 07.. or 71… or 254.. or 01... Convert the number to start with +254…
e.g if a user enters “0712345678”, the program should display “+254712345678”

Hint: check for substring with conditionals

TASK 4:
Write a program that accepts email as form input or from the terminal. Validate the email by checking if it contains an “@” symbol and “.” symbol.

TASK 5:
Implement a program that takes 3 form inputs or from the terminal, and stores them in three variables. Return the largest of the three. Do this without using the inbuilt max () function!
The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that programs normally take care of for us.
Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, display out a different message.

TASK 6:
With a given tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.

TASK 7:
Write a program that displays all prime numbers between 1 and 200.
Hint: A prime number is a number that is divisible by either 1 and itself.
